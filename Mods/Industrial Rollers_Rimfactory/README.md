# Project-RimFactory-Revived

## Factorio Inspired Automation mod in RimWorld
This is my overhaul of one of my favorite mods from B18 RW.
I tried stay in line with how it was back then but expanding on functions and machines to great a even better story for it.

Over the past month that I have been working on this mod, many great ppl have joined and contributed to make this mod truly amazing and better than I ever imagined.
I truly appreciate what this has become, not just some modding experience, but a great little community of modders, helping on PRF and sharing skills across their own mods.

This is still a work in progress project, and it probably always will be.


If you have any ideas, bugs or other things, feel free to share them with us with an issue, steam comment, or on our discord.




## Idea behind this mod
PRF is a mod that focuses on automating many task in Rimworld without going too far away from Vanilla balance.
It fits well in conjunction with many other great mods, offering new playstyles.

We have tried keep Core clean and not too unbalanced, and moving all the  OP stuff to PRF - Insanity and other sub mods instead.

This mod adds many machines and new types of automation. You can now automate certain things in Rimworld that otherwise would have required pawns.
Not every task can be automated though. you will still need pawns to eat your food, defend your colony, raid, trade, and research.

This adds new Factorio-like buildings that have a Input and a Output and will work unattendedly if you supply resources.
It also adds conveyor belts that let you move things around on your base.

There are also new storage options too.

We have worked towards more balance and lore, so it now has more ingame content, and info/story/flavour text to be more immersive.
