	<description>Adds refrigerated racks to keep food and other perishables cold.  Ideal for use in dining rooms, freeing up labour from feeding prisoners, or keeping food on hand for cooks.

Updated this mod based on my limited understanding of C#, Rimworld, and Harmony. No guarantees are made about it's reliability or functionality.
The old Readme is enclosed below, for reference. The GitHub listed below is for 1.3, I have not yet made a repo for this 1.4 update.

See the old posts for instructions and guides to usage.

CURRENT ISSUES:
- The mod setting Power Factor has no effect.
