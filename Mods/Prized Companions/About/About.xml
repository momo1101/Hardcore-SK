	<description>---Base Functionality---
Prevents any named animals from being included for consideration by the autoslaughterer. Optionally, Prized Companions may be included in animal counts if desired- mind that you update your slaughter quotas!

By default, Prized Companions are not counted in the Autoslaughter dialogue box. If you prefer to see animal counts including the Prized Companions, this can be enabled in the mod menu.

Named animals can still be manually slaughtered for tough seasons and are still included in sales listings, but your prized animals and beloved pets will be spared from voracious butchers with the excuse of 'Just doing their jobs'.

---Expanded Utility of the Autoslaughter--
Now includes additional fixes and expansion to the Autoslaughter system:

A new column is added to the autoslaughter dialog box- Youngest First. This option allows you to prefer killing younger members before older. If you plan on training large amounts of trainable or producing animals, you may find this more useful than naming each animal!

---Lite Mode Compatability---
While I would like to hear about any compability errors, there are emergency options to reduce all functions save those listed as Base Functions above. Additionally, the additional GUI can separately be toggled. Please try these in the event of incompability.

---Various Bugfixes---
Many bugfixes are included in the full version. The list of animals to slaughter are more consistently updated, and some things work as actually described (e.g. pregnant animals will now always be last to be added to the slaughter lists, whereas vanilla accidentally has them at the front of the line).
	
	===Save Game Compatability===
Prized Companions can be activated and deactivated midgame, however expect to need to update your autoslaughter numbers! Aside from the compatability settings, options will take effect immediately without need for restart.
	
	===Mod Compatability===
Please let me know if conflicts arise. The mod is intended to be highly compatible, but conflicts are due to arise.
