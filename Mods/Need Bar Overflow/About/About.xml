Pawn's Need Bars are no longer clamped to 100%.

This mod allows pawn's need bars to overflow, so children/modded races with small bodysize/pets can actually eat a full meal and get all of the 0.9 nutrition, instead of wasting a good chunk of them due to hunger being capped at 100% in vanilla. It can also allow needs such as sleep and recreation to overflow.

By default (configurable) a pawn can reach up to 200% food (higher if the pawn is small, allowing consuming at least 1 extra unit of food), sleep, and recreation.
