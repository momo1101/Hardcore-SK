  <PfE_Settings_Info>"Possessions for Everyone" only works at generation time for pawns.\nThat means you will not be able to generate possessions for pawns already on the map.\nNewly spawned pawns can either be direct colonists or from another faction, where their hostility determines if they are just a "Visitor" or a "Raider".</PfE_Settings_Info>

  <PfE_Settings_PerformanceWatchdog_Tip>Enables performance watchdog, allows investigating potential impact of possession generation on pawn generation time.</PfE_Settings_PerformanceWatchdog_Tip>
  <PfE_Settings_PerformanceWatchdog_Instructions>You have enabled the performance watchdog, which will start/stop a stop watch when a pawn starts/finishes generating.

You can use the debug action menu to log out the currently gathered sample sizes for pawn generation and compare them for different % chances for possessions. Spawning incidents with points is a good debug action to use to produce big sample sizes of generated pawns.</PfE_Settings_PerformanceWatchdog_Instructions>
