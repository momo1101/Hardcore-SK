## MineralsFrozen_SK: A rimworld mod for the [Hardcore SK project](https://github.com/skyarkhangel/Hardcore-SK)

![](About/Preview.jpg)


This mod is an extension of [Minerals_SK](https://github.com/zachary-foster/Minerals_SK) and must come after it in the load order.


## Dynamic minerals

These spawn, grow, and shrink depending on conditions.

```{r}
print_minerals("Defs/ThingsDefs_Minerals/DynamicMinerals.xml")
```


## Resources




## Installation

You can download the current development version by clicking the green "clone or download" button near the top of this page. You can also download specific "stable" releases [here](https://github.com/zachary-foster/MineralsExtra/releases), although they will probably not be updated too often. Once you have downloaded the mod, uncompress the file and up the folder in the `Mods` folder of you rimworld installation.



## To xml modders and potential contributers:

This mod is set up so that new minerals, both static and dynamic, can be added and configured using only XML changes.
Adding:

```
<ThingDef ParentName="StaticMineralBase">
		<defName>MyNewMineral</defName>
    ...
</ThingDef>
```

or

```
<ThingDef ParentName="DynamicMineralBase">
		<defName>MyNewMineral</defName>
    ...
</ThingDef>
```

to an XML file in `Defs/ThingDefs_Minerals` will cause a new mineral to be added to the game.

To add a mineral: 

* Copy the `ThingDef` for an existing mineral that is most similar to the one you want to make. Modify the XML how you want and add it to an XML file in `Defs/ThingDefs_Minerals`. Make sure to change the `defName`.
* Create textures for the new mineral and add to them to `Textures/Things/Mineral` in the same format as the others there.
* If you want to have you changes added to this mod for others to use, consider [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository and submitting a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). I welcome contributions!
