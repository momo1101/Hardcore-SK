<!-- main tab gui helper -->
	<Kopp_CYM_HelperWhichMedicine1>1: The way how the mod decides which medicine to use to tend a hediff is quite simple:\nFirst, the mod checks if a medicine has been manually assigned to a pawns instance of a hediff. This can be done in the pawns health tab by clicking on the lowly visible button which is added for every tendable hediff. This will ignore the pawns settings. If no medicine is manually assigned, the settings in this gui come into play and we jump to (2).\nNote that if the gui settings select a better medicine than what the pawn allows, the best medicine the pawn allows is used.</Kopp_CYM_HelperWhichMedicine1>
	<Kopp_CYM_HelperWhichMedicine2>2: If the immunity is lower than the set value, this medicine is used. This should be useful for the first tend(s) where we are not sure how things will turn out.\n\nExample: Immunity is at 15%, the slider is set to 20%. So the immunity is lower than the set value, the statement is true and this medicine is used. If the slider is set to 10%, the statement is false and we jump to (3).</Kopp_CYM_HelperWhichMedicine2>
	<Kopp_CYM_HelperWhichMedicine3>3: If the immunity exceeds severity by less than the specified value (or not at all), this kind of medicine gets used.\n\nExample: Immunity is at 50%, severity is at 46%. So the immunity is 4% ahead of the severity. If the slider is set to 5%, the statement is true and this medicine gets used. If the slider is set to 3%, the statement is false and we jump to (4).</Kopp_CYM_HelperWhichMedicine3>
	<Kopp_CYM_HelperWhichMedicine4>4: If the immunity is ahead of the severity by at least the set value, this kind of medicine gets used.\n\nExample: Immunity is at 40%, severity is at 15%. So the immunity is 25% ahead of the severity. If the slider is set to 10%, the statement is true and this medicine gets used. If the slider is set to 30%, the statement is false and we jump to (5).</Kopp_CYM_HelperWhichMedicine4>
	<Kopp_CYM_HelperWhichMedicine5>5: If none of the previous statements were true, this medicine gets used.\n\nSome hediffs only have this option though: The ones that do not have a comp immunizable.</Kopp_CYM_HelperWhichMedicine5>
	<Kopp_CYM_HelperCopyPaste>You can copy a page, a column or a entry. Each of them can be pasted into another. E.g. you can copy a column and paste it into a row. Note that copying does not actually copy the content, but only saves which page/column/entry to copy. So if you copy, change and then paste something, the changes will also be pasted.</Kopp_CYM_HelperCopyPaste>
	<Kopp_CYM_HelperLeftButtons>If you click 'default settings' a dropdown menu will appear where you can select 'this page' or 'all pages'.\n\nThe 'update hediff list' is needed if you have added or removed mods that included tendable hediffs.\n\nThe operations button opens a new gui where you can specify the medicine for operations and one or two other options.</Kopp_CYM_HelperLeftButtons>
	<Kopp_CYM_HelperLabels>Some hediffs have the same label. If you hover over the label, you can see the defName. As it is impossible to know which hediff can affect which kind of pawn, each list contains every tendable hediff.\nYou can hide entries from the list by clicking on its label, then 'hide'. In this way, a list can be freed from unnecessary entries.</Kopp_CYM_HelperLabels>
