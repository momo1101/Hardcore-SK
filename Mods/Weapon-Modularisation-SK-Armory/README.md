# Weapon-Modularisation-SK-Armory
Conversion of Weapon Modularisation Weapon Pack for HSK.

I consider this a community project. Support for other mods, or balance changes are something im going to mainly leave to others. As its such a big mod.

**Description**

As the titles  suggests, this overhauls not only the textures for weapons, but also adds attachments or upgrades. Weapons can be upgraded at the various weapon crafting benches. Enemies will also spawn with weapons with various attachments. (unsure if the AI will use the abilities granted by attachments, this may need a SkyAI update)

I consider this to be an Alpha. Especially because ideally, weapons stats need reducing so that attachments, make up the difference, for example a rifle is made without a scope. its accuracy should be lowered significantly. Weapon costs could also be reduced to reflect this. For now however, attachments act as stat boosts or changes for current weapons.
